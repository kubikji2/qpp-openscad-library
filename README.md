# Q++ Openscad Library

Set of useful geometries variants and utilities for descriptive modeling tool OpenScad.

## TODOs

- [X] utilities - check functions for intuitive and general API including unit tests.
- [X] ***dice*** (first, since it is an easy shape)
- [ ] ***cylindrocube*** - cylinder-cube hybrid (corners and sides are rouned in xy-plane only)
- [x] ***spherocube*** - sphere-cube hybrid
- [ ] ***decornered_cube*** - cube with all corners cut off
- [ ] ***deedged_cube*** - cube with edges cut off
- [ ] make all geometries alignable to center in xyz and to center in xy-plane
- [ ] create functions for getting the transform (translation and rotation) to the center of each side, edge, and corner of basic geometries
- [ ] duplicate this functionality for the advanced geometries
- [ ] create modules for shell-like geometries
- [ ] create modules for box-like geometries including the lid and the box itself
- [ ] create patterns generators for pattern cutters
